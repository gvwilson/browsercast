# Contributor's Guide

The new version of Browsercast lives in `./docs`
so that it can be shared as a GitHub Pages site.
[This post][snap-scroll] by [Yihui Xie][xie]
explains how the slideshow part adds an observer to each slide to snap-scroll the slide into view.
The audio snippets are played automatically at the same time.

> Note: the demonstration in `./docs` uses handwritten HTML.
> In practice,
> we expect that most browsercasts will be generated from Markdown by a template engine.
