Feedback from friends F1 & F2

Overall: Button navigation was intuitive, both would click the expected buttons for each feature.

Feature #1 : Audio Playback Bar 
- Both expected to click the button on the bottom left of the default view to expand the audio playback bar.
- F1 expected volume button to show a slider that pops upwards.
- F2 expected the caption button to either show the captions in a default language (referenced Youtube's closed captions button) or show options for multiple languages then choose one.

Feature #2 : Help Page
- Both clicked the ? button on the top right of the default view.
- F1 expected to open a new window (due to unfamiliarity with clicking help pages), F2 anticipated a pop-up window.
- Suggested having more navigation like a table of contents or menu to choose sections from.
- Both wanted to be able to jump to certain sections and go back to the top of the help page easily.

Feature #3 : Slide Navigation
- Both clicked the hamburger button on the top left corner of the default view.
- Both suggested showing the total number of slides and what slide number you are currently on (eg. Slide 1/12).
- Both expected to close the panel by clicking the hamburger button again.
- Both expected to use the arrow keys or click the screen to go to the next slide.

Feature #4 : Autoplay
- F1 found the autoplay toggle button unfamiliar, F2 thought it was fine.
- F1 expected something similar to the “Live” Tag on Twitch/Youtube when you’re watching a livestream to indicate when autoplay is on.
- Both emphasized wanting a slide number on the bottom corner.
- Alternatively, F2 suggested having the slide navigation panel open on the left that updates/highlights the new slide as autoplay changes slides.
- F2 said no other indicator was needed as the slides change.
